# Project 2 — Messier Observing Assistant

**Course:** Astronomy 1221  
**Authors:** Abdirahman Abdullahi, Kyle Drees  

This repository contains our Project 2 notebook for Astronomy 1221.  
We build a small “Messier observing assistant” that turns the classic Messier catalog
into practical observing tools.

## Project Overview

We follow the **Pandas + Astropy (Pathway B)** approach:

- Load and clean the provided `MessierObjects.xls` catalog into a consistent table of
  all 110 Messier objects.
- Add useful derived columns:
  - standardized RA/Dec,
  - broad type categories (`Galaxy`, `Nebula`, `Cluster`, `Other`),
  - best viewing month and season.
- Build helper functions and visualizations to:
  - filter objects by type, magnitude, and constellation,
  - explore type and magnitude distributions,
  - generate observing plans by season or month and equipment tier,
  - recommend “Top 5” targets, with simple sky charts.

There is also an **optional advanced section** that:
- accepts a user’s city, month, and gear description,
- builds a location-specific Top 5 list,
- plots flat RA/Dec and dome-view charts,
- and includes a playful distance visualization (“freedom units”) for one target.

All advanced pieces are built on top of the same cleaned Messier table.

## Files

- `Project2_DataWrangling.ipynb`  
  Main notebook with all code, explanations, and results.

- `MessierObjects.xls`  
  Source catalog provided for the project.

- `data/messier_clean.csv`  
  Cleaned Messier catalog generated by the notebook.

(Any other catalogs from early attempts are treated as archive/experiments and are not
used in the final workflow.)
